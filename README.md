# St.-Benedicta-s-College-Academic-Performance-Analysis-2013-Session-
Project Summary:  This project evaluates the academic performance, demographic composition, and accommodation preferences of St. Benedicta's College students during the 2013 session using a detailed Power BI dashboard. The goal is to identify key trends, challenges, and opportunities to enhance academic outcomes and improve student well-being.


Key Skills:

1. Data Visualization and Analytics: Using Power BI to extract meaningful insights.  
2. Trend Identification: Analyzing grades, demographics, and housing patterns.  
3. Strategic Problem-Solving: Proposing solutions based on evidence.  
4. Stakeholder Communication: Presenting insights clearly for decision-making.  
5. Action Planning: Creating data-driven, student-focused strategies.  
 

Observations:  

1. Academic Performance:
   - The most frequent grade is **DD**, indicating the need for academic improvement programs.  
   - High grades (AA, BB, BA) are scarce, while failures remain minimal.  

2. Demographics:
   - Gender Distribution:Females (60%) outnumber males (40%).  
   - Age Group: The majority (70 students) are aged **22-25**, followed by **18-21 years**.  

3. High School Background: 
   - State high schools account for the majority (71%) of the student population.  

4. Accommodation Preferences:
   - Rented housing is the top choice (68 students), followed by dormitories (49).  

5. Parental Status:

   - Offer subsidies or financial aid for students in need of affordable housing.  

4. Targeted Support for Unique Groups:  
   - Provide career and academic advising tailored to older students (above 25 years).  
   - Establish emotional and academic support systems for students with divorced or deceased parents.  

5. Parental Engagement Programs:
   - Host parent-student engagement events to strengthen family involvement in academic progress.  

6. Grade Tracking and Feedback:
   - Introduce periodic academic progress reviews and feedback sessions to help students track and improve their performance.  

 

Conclusion

The analysis underscores the need for interventions to address academic performance gaps, strengthen partnerships with feeder schools, and improve student living conditions. By implementing these recommendations, the institution can create an environment that fosters academic excellence, supports student diversity, and enhances overall student well-being. These changes will contribute to sustained institutional growth and improved student outcomes.
